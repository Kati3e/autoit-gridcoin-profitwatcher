(October 29th, 2015)

  This script watches BTC-USD and BTC-GRC Prices and alerts you to profit margins based on the price you bought
 	  into BTC and GRC in the past. Please edit the "User Settings" for your own profit margins.

  Compile as CommandLine-UI (CUI) for Console Output or Run in SciTE

To-do:
------
  * Save settings to ini and add script inputs
  * Add other exchanges
  * Add email/text alerts
  * Simplify error handling

Changes:
-------
  * v0.2: Added error handling, should be no more crashes, please report any crashes to me.
